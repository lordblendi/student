Feature: During Laboratory information
  As a student
  I want to get the git repository URL
  and I want to know the leftover time

  Scenario: Get leftover time and repository URL
    Given I am using laboradmin
    And I am on the during laboratory page
    When  I press the Labor alatt button
    Then I see the remaining time till the deadline
    And I see the repository URL: "git@gitlab.db.bme.hu:pelda/pelda.git"
    And I see the entry test grade and the demonstrator's name: 5 ("Teszt Oktat√≥ 1")
    And I see a list of commits
